📊 Project Title:
Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard

🧠 Objective:
To analyze historical sales data to identify business trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that help improve decision-making and increase revenue.

🔍 Project Description:
In this project, I worked with a large dataset containing sales transactions of an e-commerce company. The analysis focused on understanding:

Monthly and quarterly sales trends

Best-selling products by category

Regional sales performance

Customer buying patterns and retention

Sales channel effectiveness (online vs offline)

Using data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, I created an interactive dashboard that allows business stakeholders to explore insights and track KPIs in real time.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
Python: Data cleaning (Pandas), analysis (NumPy), and visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL: Querying structured sales data from relational databases

Excel: Quick pivot tables and preliminary EDA

Power BI / Tableau: To create dynamic, interactive dashboards and data visualizations

Jupyter Notebook: For developing and documenting analysis

📈 Key Insights Discovered:
20% of products generated 80% of revenue (Pareto principle)

Sales dip in Q2 due to seasonal trends

Region X had high cart abandonment rates

Mobile users converted at higher rates than desktop users

🎯 Outcome & Impact:
Helped the marketing team refocus ad budget toward high-converting channels

Informed product restocking strategy based on demand forecasting

Contributed to a 12% increase in targeted sales for Q4

✅ Skills Demonstrated:
Data wrangling and cleaning

Statistical analysis & data storytelling

Business intelligence and decision support
